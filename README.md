# Pyber AnalysisSchool District Analysis
Using Jupiter Notes and Pandas to Analyse School district related data

Overview of Project

-Purpose

We gave our client, V.Isualize, an analysis a detailed analysis if their ride_share business for various city types(urban, suburban and rural).
We also analysed the rides over a period , average cost, driver related information etc
 

V. Isualize, has now given us and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we’ll create
a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we’ll create a multiple-line
 graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the
data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.




 Analysis and Challenges

City Types - Urban, Suburban and Rural and there are many places in each city type.

There are rougly around 3000 drivers registered with Pyber and most of them are in the Urban cities

Usages is highest in urban cities and lowest in rural areas

On the other hand the average ride fare is highest in rural areas and lowest in Urban cities

- Overall conclusion and 3 recommendations

The cost for rides is higher in rural areas as compared to urban areas. Is it because of longer driving distance? Is there no ride share? etc

1) Analsysis should be done to find out why the average cost of a ride in rural areas is so high.

This analysis will give us insight into why usage of Pyber is low in rural areas

2) There aer so many registered drivers in the urban areas but the fares generated is relatively low compared to the ratio in suburban areas.
Suburban areas with far fewer drivers is generating higher income compared to urban areas. The root cause for this needs to be analysed. 

3) Pyber should look at increaseing the driver count in suburban and rural areas as the income per ride and driver is higher as compared to in cities.
